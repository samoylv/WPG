# WPG 

WPG, WavePropaGator, is an interactive simulation framework for X-ray wavefront propagation. 

WPG provides intuitive interface to the [SRW library](https://github.com/ochubar/SRW). The [application examples](http://wpg.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tutorials.html) are  mainly oriented on [European XFEL](http://www.xfel.eu) design parameters. To learn more details, see [online documentation pages](http://wpg.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html).

# Fast installation
## Python requiements

From relese 2019.12 we drop support of python2. Please use python 3.6 or 3.7.

## Get sources
Download sources https://github.com/samoylv/WPG/archive/develop.zip or clone git repository 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/samoylv/WPG.git
```

## Install python environment

Install conda from https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html or https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/ or from command line on Linux
```bash
wget -c https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

Install dependencies
```bash
conda create -n wpg36 --file requirements.txt -c conda-forge -y
conda activate wpg36
```

## For Maxwell server users

For DESY Maxwell server you usually should install conda env to your GPSF partition, for example
```bash
conda create --prefix /gpfs/exfel/data/user/buzmakov/conda_env/wpg36 --file requirements.txt -c conda-forge -y
```

## Build Linux version
```bash
cd WPG
make
```

if you need SRW with OpenMP support (currently crashed on Maxwell in some cases)


```bash
cd WPG
OPENMP_MODE=omp make
```

## Get Windows binaries

WPG contain original SRW binaries for python 3.6 x64 with OpenMP support.
Other windows binaries of SRW may be copied from original SRW repository (https://github.com/ochubar/SRW/tree/master/env/work/srw_python/lib) and placed in WPG/wpg/srw folder

## Run smaples

Run
````bash
cd WPG
jupyter notebook
````
Try run samples from WPG/samples/Tutorials
